# Musician Simulator

A basic game written in C# using [raylib bindings](https://github.com/ZeroElectric/Raylib-CSharp-Vinculum). The basic premise is about becoming a musician and building a music empire.

## Building
At the moment the game can be built just by using the `dotnet run` command in the terminal. (Although there isn't much of a game to be found)
